    <h2> ABOUT US</h2>
    <br>
    <p>As climate change accelerates due to excessive carbon emissions, decisive action is imperative to ensure a better world for current and future generations. In 2023, humanity crossed the critical 1.5°C threshold, and we are projected to reach 2.4°C by the end of the century. 
 
        This could result in devastating crop losses for India, potentially costing the economy $28.62 billion between 2030 and 2050, and ballooning to $612 billion to $1 trillion by 2050-2100. With 45.8% of India's workforce dependent on agriculture, contributing about 17% to the GDP, and feeding the world's largest population, the stakes are high. 
         
        Indian agriculture, predominantly comprised of smallholders, faces the greatest peril.
         <br><b>At Ankooram Biotech</b>, we are committed to pioneering sustainable solutions to address the critical issue of crop residue disposal through biomass burning. 
        Our mission is to sequester carbon emissions permanently in the soil, enhancing soil health and fertility while actively participating in the burgeoning carbon credit market. 
         
        This approach not only promotes sustainability but also provides farmers with a reliable supplementary income through biochar production by following regenerative agriculture practices. Join us in transforming agricultural practices, reducing carbon emissions, and creating a sustainable future for all</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<br>
<p>Paul Hawken (1993) advised: —Leave the world better than you found it, take no more than you need, try not to harm life or the environment, make amends if you do.
<b>“The first rule of sustainability is to align with natural forces or at least not try to defy them".</b>
    The concept of sustainable agriculture set out by the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) states —
<b>Sustainable agriculture is the successful management of resources for agriculture to satisfy the changing human needs, while maintaining or enhancing the quality of environment and conserving natural resources.</b>  </p>

<h2>PROBLEM STATEMENT</h2>

<br>
<br>
<img src="pic3.png" class="tie">
<p>In the past 50 years, human activities have caused <b>Earth's average surface temperature to rise by about 1.8°F</b> (1.0°C), shifting us from the Holocene, which lasted 10,000 years, into the Anthropocene. This rapid warming poses a significant risk of <b>destabilizing the planet's delicate climate systems.</b> 
 
    One of the critical regulatory systems affected is the polar ice caps, particularly the <b>Greenland ice sheet</b>. These ice caps play a crucial role in reflecting sunlight, with around<b> 99% of the sun's energy</b> being reflected back into space. However, as glaciers and ice caps melt due to rising temperatures, this <b>self-cooling mechanism is being compromised</b> , leading to further warming and contributing to a dangerous feedback loop.
     
    The melting of the Greenland ice sheet, which contains approximately 8% of Earth's freshwater, is accelerating, contributing to <b>rising sea levels and altering global weather patterns.</b> The Arctic sea ice is also declining rapidly in both thickness and extent, exacerbating the warming effect. 
</b>This shift from a self-cooling to a self-warming state threatens to disrupt the balance of the entire planet's climate system </b>, highlighting the urgent need for addressing climate change and mitigating its impacts through sustainable practices and policies</p>

    <h2>WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW, AT THIS MOMENT?</h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>The <b>Amazon</b> rainforest, for example, is experiencing prolonged dry seasons and deforestation due to soya farming and livestock, pushing it towards an irreversible process known as "savannization." This transformation from rainforest to savannah not only diminishes its capacity to generate rainfall and recycle water but also results in the release of approximately 200 billion tons of CO2 over the next 30 years, equivalent to the world’s carbon emissions in five years .</p>
    <p>The loss of biodiversity is equally alarming, with 1 million of the estimated 8 million animal and plant species currently threatened with extinction, marking the onset of the sixth mass extinction. Intensive monoculture farming has severely impacted insect populations, such as bumblebees in the UK, which are vital for pollination. 
 
        Without insect pollinators, agricultural ecosystems cannot function properly, underscoring the dire biodiversity crisis. Freshwater systems, often referred to as the planet's bloodstream, are also under threat, with the average person requiring 3000 liters of water per day. 
         
        As wild species now only make up 4% of the total biomass, the loss of any more species risks destabilizing entire ecosystems. This highlights the urgent need to protect and restore biodiversity to maintain the planet's ecological balance </p>

        <h2>THE IMPACT OF WATER AND NUTRIENT USE ON ECOSYSTEMS</h2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li><b>Water Use and Nutrient Flow:</b> Water is crucial for various aspects of human life, including hygiene, drinking, and industrial needs. On average, 50 liters are allocated for hygiene and drinking, 150 to 300 liters for washing and industrial purposes, and a significant 2,500 liters for food production. This intensive use of water affects nutrient flow, particularly through the application of fertilizers, which introduce key nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus into ecosystems. Excessive use of these nutrients can lead to eutrophication, a process where water bodies become over-enriched with nutrients, causing harmful algal blooms. These blooms decompose, leading to oxygen depletion, which can cause massive die-offs of aquatic life and disrupt entire marine ecosystems.</li>
         <br>
        <li> <b>Acidification and Climate Impact: </b>The overuse of nitrogen and phosphorus, coupled with increased carbon dioxide emissions, contributes to several environmental issues. Approximately one-third of CO2 emissions are absorbed by the oceans, leading to ocean acidification. The reaction of CO2 with seawater forms carbonic acid, which lowers the pH of the oceans, making them 26% more acidic. This acidification adversely affects marine organisms, particularly those with calcium carbonate shells or skeletons, as the availability of carbonate ions decreases. This disruption can cause mass extinctions and affect the stability of marine ecosystems.</li>
        <br>
    <li><b>Global Disruptions and Aerosol Effects:</b> Human activities have introduced novel entities, such as nuclear waste and microplastics, causing planet-wide disruptions. Aerosols from fossil fuel combustion contribute to global dimming by intercepting sunlight and creating hazy skies. While this phenomenon temporarily masks some effects of global warming, it is not a solution. Aerosols not only affect climate but also contribute to air pollution, which is responsible for approximately 7.5 million deaths annually. This pollution reduces life expectancy and underscores the need to address the overuse of aerosols and other pollutants to prevent crossing critical environmental boundaries.</li>
